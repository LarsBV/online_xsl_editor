Simple XSL Editor
================================================
A simple online javascript, xsl / xslt editor.

Not much else to say about the project, it is quite straighforward, no require.js etc..
just a few includes in index.html. The main application is in js/app.js .

Any suggestions, bugs, commments, patches, shout-outs etc.. is very much appreciated.

My little xsl editor, is so simple because others have made some great libraries.
